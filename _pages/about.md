I am currently a PhD student at the [Institute of Automation](http://www.ia.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences, in the Brain Atlas and Brain-Inspired Intelligence Laboratory, under the supervision of Researcher [Shan.Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YdaRHiIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) since 2021. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronic Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, where I studied from 2017 to 2021.

Research Interest
======
My research is in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am fascinated by the potential of flexible deep learning inspired by the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. The prefrontal cortex, key to higher cognitive functions and a cornerstone of intelligence, coupled with the hippocampus's critical role in memory systems, guides my efforts to develop more brain-like and robust artificial neural networks. Currently, my work is centered on visual reasoning tasks and reinforcement learning. Additionally, I am experimenting with tasks originally designed for primates to assess prefrontal cortex functions on large language models(LLMs), which I find particularly intriguing.
